2 - Set Minimum Main Voltage (Command 57 Preferred)
Sets main battery (B- / B+) minimum voltage level. If the battery voltages drops below the set
voltage level RoboClaw will stop driving the motors. The voltage is set in .2 volt increments. A
value of 0 sets the minimum value allowed which is 6V. The valid data range is 0 - 140 (6V -
34V). The formula for calculating the voltage is: (Desired Volts - 6) x 5 = Value. Examples of
valid values are 6V = 0, 8V = 10 and 11V = 25.

3 - Set Maximum Main Voltage (Command 57 Preferred)
Sets main battery (B- / B+) maximum voltage level. The valid data range is 30 - 175 (6V -
34V). During regenerative breaking a back voltage is applied to charge the battery. When using
a power supply, by setting the maximum voltage level, RoboClaw will, before exceeding it, go
into hard braking mode until the voltage drops below the maximum value set. This will prevent
overvoltage conditions when using power supplies. The formula for calculating the voltage is:
Desired Volts x 5.12 = Value. Examples of valid values are 12V = 62, 16V = 82 and 24V = 123.

Advanced Packet Serial
Commands
The following commands are used to read RoboClaw status information, version information and
to set or read configuration values. All commands sent to RoboClaw need to be signed with a
CRC16 (Cyclic Redundancy Check of 2 bytes) to validate each packet it received. This is more
complex than a simple checksum but prevents errors that could otherwise cause unexpected
actions to execute on the Roboclaw. See Packet Serial section of this manual for an explanation
on how to create the CRC16 values.

Encoders
Closed Loop Modes
RoboClaw supports a wide range of encoders for close loop modes. Encoders are used in velocity,
position or a cascaded velocity with position control mode. This manual mainly deals with
Quadrature and Absolute encoders. However additional types of encoders are supported.
Encoder Tuning
All encoders will require tuning to properly function. Ion Studio incorperates an Auto Tune
function which can automatically tune the PID and editable fields for manual tuning of the PID.
Encoders can also be tunned using Advance Control Commands which can be sent by a MCU or
other control devices.
Quadrature Encoders Wiring
RoboClaw is capable of reading two quadrature encoders, one for each motor channel. The main
header provides two +5VDC connections with dual A and B input signals for each encoder.
Quadrature encoders are directional. In a simple two motor robot, one motor will spin clock
wise (CW) and the other motor will spin counter clock wise (CCW). The A and B inputs for one
of the encoders must be reversed to allow both encoders to count up when the robot is moving
forward. If both encoder are connected with leading edge pulse to channel A one will count up
and the other down. This will cause commands like Mix Drive Forward to not work as expected.
All motor and encoder combinations will need to be tuned. For model specific pinout information
please refer to the data sheet for the model being used.

Absolute Encoder Wiring
RoboClaw is capable of reading absolute encoders that output an analog voltage. Like the Analog
input modes for controlling the motors, the absolute encoder voltage must be between 0v and
2v. If using standard potentiometers as absolute encoders the 5v from the RoboClaw can be
divided down to 2v at the potentiometer by adding a resistor from the 5v line on the RoboClaw
to the potentiometer. For a 5k pot R1 / R2 = 7.5k, for a 10k pot R1 / R2 = 15k and for a 20k
pot R1 / R2 = 30k.
The diagram below shows the main battery as the only power source. Make sure the LB jumper
is installed. The 5VDC shown connected is only required if your MCU needs a power source. This
is the BEC feature of RoboClaw. If the MCU has its own power source do not connect the 5VDC.

Encoder Tuning
To control motor speed and or position with an encoder the PID must be calibrated for the
specific motor and encoder being used. Using Motion Studio the PID can be tuned manually or
by the auto tune fucntion. Once the encoders are tuned the settings can be saved to the onboard
eeprom and will be loaded each time the unit powers up.
The Motion Studio window for Velocity Settings will auto tune for velocity. The window for
Position Settings can tune a simple PD position controller, a PID position controller or a cascaded
Position with Velocity controller(PIV). The cascaded tune will determine both the velocity and
position values for the motor. Auto tune functions usually return reasonable values but manual
adjustments may be required for optimum performance.
Auto Tuning
Motion Studio provides the option to auto tune velocity and position control. To use the auto
tune option make sure the encoder and motor are running in the desired direction and the basic
PWM control of the motor works as expected. It is recommend to ensure the motor and encoder
combination are functioning properly before using the auto tune feature.
1. Go to the PWM Settings screen in Motion Studio.
2. Slide the motor slider up to start moving the motor forward. Check the encoder is increasing
in value. If it is not either reverse the motor wires or the encoder wires. The recheck.
3. To start auto tune click the auto tune button for the motor channel that is will be tuned first.
The auto tune function will try to determine the best settings for that motor channel.
!
If the motor or encoder are wired incorrectly, the auto tune function can lock
up and the motor controller will become unresponsive. Correct the wiring
problem and reset the motor controller to continue.

Manual Velocity Calibration Procedure
1. Determine the quadrature pulses per second(QPPS) value for your motor. The simplest
method to do this is to run the Motor at 100% duty using Ion Studio and read back the speed
value from the encoder attached to the motor. If you are unable to run the motor like this due to
physical constraints you will need to estimate the maximum speed in encoder counts the motor
can produce.
2. Set the initial P, I and D values in the Velocity control window to 1,0 and 0. Try moving the
motor using the slider controls in IonMotion. If the motor does not move it may not be wired
correctly or the P value needs to be increased. If the motor immediately runs at max speed
when you change the slider position you probably have the motor or encoder wires reversed.
The motor is trying to go at the speed specified but the encoder reading is coming back in the
opposite direction so the motor increases power until it eventually hits 100% power. Reverse the
encoder or motor wires(not both) and test again.
3. Once the motor has some semblance of control you can set a moderate speed. Then start
increasing the P value until the speed reading is near the set value. If the motor feels like it is
vibrating at higher P values you should reduce the P value to about 2/3rds that value. Move on
to the I setting.
4. Start increasing the I setting. You will usually want to increase this value by .1 increments.
The I value helps the motor reach the exact speed specified. Too high an I value will also cause
the motor to feel rough/vibrate. This is because the motor will over shoot the set speed and then
the controller will reduce power to get the speed back down which will also under shoot and this
will continue oscillating back and forth form too fast to too slow, causing a vibration in the motor.
5. Once P and I are set reasonably well usually you will leave D = 0. D is only required if you are
unable to get reasonable speed control out of the motor using just P and I. D will help dampen
P and I over shoot allowing higher P and I values, but D also increases noise in the calculation
which can cause oscillations in the speed as well.
Manual Position Calibration Procedure
1. Position mode requires the Velocity mode QPPS value be set as described above. For simple
Position control you can set Velocity P, I and D all to 0.
2. Set the Position I and D settings to 0. Set the P setting to 2000 as a reasonable starting
point. To test the motor you must also set the Speed argument to some value. We recommend
setting it to the same value as the QPPS setting(eg maximum motor speed). Set the minimum
and maximum position values to safe numbers. If your motor has no dead stops this can be +-2
billion. If your motor has specific dead stops(like on a linear actuator) you will need to manually
move the motor to its dead stops to determine these numbers. Leave some margin infront of
each deadstop. Note that when using quadrature encoders you will need to home your motor on
every power up since the quadrature readings are all relative to the starting position unless you
set/reset the encoder values.
3. At this point the motor should move in the appropriate direction and stop, not necessarily
close to the set position when you move the slider. Increase the P setting until the position
is over shooting some each time you change the position slider. Now start increasing the D
setting(leave I at 0). Increasing D will add dampening to the movement when getting close
to the set position. This will help prevent the over shoot. D will usually be anywhere from 5 to
20 times larger than P but not always. Continue increasing P and D until the motor is working
reasonably well. Once it is you have tuned a simple PD system.

4. Once your position control is acting relatively smoothly and coming close to the set position
you can think about adjusting the I setting. Adding I will help reach the exact set point specified
but in most motor systems there is enough slop in the gears that instead you will end up causing
an oscillation around the specified position. This is called hunting. The I setting causes this when
there is any slop in the motor/encoder/gear train. You can compensate some for this by adding
deadzone. Deadzone is the area around the specified position the controller will consider to be
equal to the position specified.
5. One more setting must be adjusted in order to use the I setting. The Imax value sets the
maximum wind up allowed for the I setting calculation. Increasing Imax will allow I to affect a
larger amount of the movement of the motor but will also allow the system to oscillate if used
with a badly tuned I and/or set too high.

50 - Drive M1 / M2 With Signed Speed And Individual Acceleration
Drive M1 and M2 in the same command using one value for acceleration and two signed speed
values for each motor. The sign indicates which direction the motor will run. The acceleration
value is not signed. The motors are sync during acceleration. This command is used to drive
the motor by quad pulses per second and using an acceleration value for ramping. Different
quadrature encoders will have different rates at which they generate the incoming pulses. The
values used will differ from one encoder to another. Once a value is sent the motor will begin to
accelerate incrementally until the rate defined is reached.
Send: [Address, 50, AccelM1(4 Bytes), SpeedM1(4 Bytes), AccelM2(4 Bytes),
SpeedM2(4 Bytes), CRC(2 bytes)]
Receive: [0xFF]
The acceleration is measured in speed increase per second. An acceleration value of 12,000
QPPS with a speed of 12,000 QPPS would accelerate a motor from 0 to 12,000 QPPS in 1 second.
Another example would be an acceleration value of 24,000 QPPS and a speed value of 12,000
QPPS would accelerate the motor to 12,000 QPPS in 0.5 seconds.
